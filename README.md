## Question 1

Create an array of strings called `colors` that contain "orange", "red", "yellow", "turquoise", and "lavender".

Then, using array subscripting and string interpolation, print out the String `"orange, yellow, and lavender are some of my favorite colors"`. 
```swift 
let colors = ["orange" , "red" , "yellow" , "turquoise", "lavender"]
print("\(colors[0])" + " " + "\(colors[1])" + " " + "\(colors[3])" + " " + "are some of my favorite colors.")

```


## Question 2

Remove "Illinois" and "Kansas" from the array below.

`var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]
```swift 
var westernStates = ["California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Kansas"]
westernStates.remove(at: 4)
westernStates.remove(at: 4)
print(westernStates)


```

## Question 3

Iterate through the array below. For each each state, print out whether or not it is **in the continental United States.**

```Swift 
let moreStates = ["Hawaii", "New Mexico", "Alaska", "Montana", "Texas", "New York", "Florida"]
var outside = [String()]
var hawa = "Hawaii"
var alaska = "Alaska"
for states in moreStates {
if states == hawa || states == alaska {
print("\(states) is not in the continental united states")
continue
}
print("\(states) is in the continental United States!"  )
}



```


## Question 4

Print out how many non-whitespace characters are in `myString`:

`let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"`

Iterate through the array below. For each sentence, print out how many non-whitespace characters are in it.

`let myFavoriteQuotes = ["To be or not to be, that is the question.", "The only source of knowledge is experience.", "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!", "Four score and twenty years ago..."]` 

```Swift 
let myString = "This is good practice with Strings!"
var spaceCount = 0
for spaces in myString {
if spaces == " " {
spaceCount += 1
continue
}
}
print("The amount of spaces is \(spaceCount)")



```


## Question 5

Iterate through `garden` and place any ðŸŒ· that you find into the `basket`. Replace any ðŸŒ· that you pick up with `"dirt"`. Then print how many ðŸŒ· are in your `basket`.

```swift 
var garden = ["dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt","ðŸŒ·","dirt"]
var basket = [String]()
var flowerCount = 0
var index = 0
for (index,stuff) in garden.enumerated() {

if  stuff == "ðŸŒ·" {
flowerCount += 1
basket.append(stuff)
garden[index] = "dirt "


}
}
print("There are \(flowerCount) flowers in my basket \(basket) but my garden is just dirt now!! \(garden)")
```

## Question 6

The below array represents an unfinished batting lineup for a baseball team. **You, the coach,** need to make some last minute changes:

- Add "Suzuki" to the end of your lineup.
- Change "Jeter" to "Tejada".
- Change "Thomas" for "Guerrero"
- Put "Reyes" to bat 8th instead.

```Swift 

var battingLineup = ["Reyes", "Jeter", "Ramirez", "Pujols","Griffey","Thomas","Jones", "Rodriguez"]

for (index, player) in battingLineup.enumerated() {


if  player == "Jeter" {
battingLineup[index] = "Tejada"
continue
}
if  player == "Thomas" {
battingLineup[index] = "Guerrero"
continue
}
if  index == 7 {
battingLineup[index] = "Reyes "
continue
}


}
battingLineup.append("Suzuki")
battingLineup.removeFirst()
print("The new batting lineup is \(battingLineup)")
```


## Question 7

Given an array of Ints, find out if it contains a target number.  

(The built-in `contains(_:)` function will do this, but you aren't allowed to use it for this exercise.)


```swift
var numbers: [Int]

let target: Int = 32
```

Ex.1

```swift
numbers = [4,2,6,73,32,4,2,1]

target = 32

//true
```

Ex. 2

```swift
numbers = [32459,2,4,5,1,4,2,1]

target = 3

//false
``` 
```Swift 
var numbers = [5,36,689,64,66,44,11,2345,6,3246,645,65879,788]
var target = 6
for number in numbers {
   if number == target {
       print("the target number \(target) is equal to the \(number) which is in our data set")
    }
}
```


## Question 8

Find the largest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built-in `max()` method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}

//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
``` 

```Swift 
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}
var greatestNumber = 0
for number in arrayOfNumbers {
if number >= 200 {
greatestNumber = number

}

}
print(greatestNumber)
```


## Question 9

Find the smallest value in an array of Int.  Do not use the built in min() method.

```swift
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}
var lowestNum = 0
//This creates an array of 100 numbers in between 0 and 200.  For now, you don't need to worry about how it does that.
for number in arrayOfNumbers {

if number <= 1 {
lowestNum = number

}
}
print(lowestNum)

```


## Question 10

Iterate through `secondListOfNumbers`, and print out all the odd numbers.

```Swift 
var secondListOfNumbers = [19,13,14,19,101,10000,141,404]
var oddnumbers: [Int] = []
for number in secondListOfNumbers {
if number % 2 == 1  {
oddnumbers.append(number)
//        print(number)

}
}
print(oddnumbers)




```


## Question 11

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum.

```Swift 

var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]
var sum = 0
for number in thirdListOfNumbers  {
if number > 0 {
sum  += number
}
}
print(sum)





```

## Question 12

Iterate through `thirdListOfNumbers`, and print out the sum of all the even numbers.

```swift 
var thirdListOfNumbers = [11, 26, 49, 61, 25, 40, 74, 3, 22, 23]
var sumEven = 0
for number in thirdListOfNumbers {
if number%2 == 0 {
sumEven += number
}
}
print(sumEven)




```


## Question 13

Append every Int that appears in both `listOne` and `listTwo` to the `sharedElements` array. Then print **how many Ints** are shared.

```swift
var listOne = [28, 64, 7, 96, 13, 32, 94, 11, 80, 68]
var listTwo = [18, 94, 48, 6, 42, 68, 79, 76, 13, 7]
var sharedElements = [Int]()
var sharedElementsCount = 0

for number1 in listOne {
for number2 in listTwo {
if number1 == number2 {
//        sharedElementsCount += 1
sharedElements.append(number1)

}
}
}
print(sharedElements.count)
print(sharedElementsCount)
```


## Question 14

Write code such that `noDupeList` has all the same Ints as `dupeFriendlyList`, but has no more than one of each Int.

```swift
var dupeFriendlyList = [4,2,6,2,2,6,4,9,2,1]
var dupeList: [Int] = [4,6,2]
var noDupeList: [Int] = []
for (index,dupe) in dupeFriendlyList.enumerated() {
if dupeList.contains(dupe)  {
noDupeList.append(dupe)
}
else if dupe > 0{
noDupeList.append(dupe)
}
else if dupeList.contains(dupe) {
noDupeList.remove(at: index)
}


}
print(noDupeList)

```

## Question 15

Find the second smallest number in an Array of Ints

```Swift 
let arrayOfNumbers: [Int] = (1...100).map{ _ in Int.random(in: 0...200)}.map{Int($0)}
var secondLowest = 0
for number in arrayOfNumbers {
if number == 2 {
secondLowest += number
}
}

print(secondLowest)


```


## Question 16

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. 

```Swift 
var multArray = [Int()]
var sum = 0
for number in 0...999  {
if number % 3 == 0 || number % 5 == 0 {
multArray.append(number)
sum += number
}
}
print(multArray)
print(sum)
```

var repeatsAgain = 0
var repeatsAgainCount = 0

var repeatsAgainArray = [Int()]

for number in someRepeatsAgain {
if number == repeatsAgain {
repeatsAgainArray.append(number)
continue
}
repeatsAgain = number
}
repeatsAgainArray.removeFirst()
print(repeatsAgainArray)

```


## Question 18

Identify if there are 3 integers that sum to 10 in the following array. If so, print them as a triplet. If there are multiple triplets, print all possible triplets.

var tripleSumArr = [-20,-14, -8,-5,-3,-2,1,2,3,4,9,15,20,30]

aCount += 1
}
}

aCountArr.append(aCount)
aCount = 0
